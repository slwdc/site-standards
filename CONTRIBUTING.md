### Pull Requests
We use pull requests to keep the document updating. Please clone this repository, make changes, and send pull request. 


### Audience
Please note that we target a wide range of web developers coming from all sorts of backgrounds. This means the recommendations we make must suit the average developer, and should be self-explanatory as much as possible. Let's try to keep the wording as simple as possible, but not miss anything important either.
