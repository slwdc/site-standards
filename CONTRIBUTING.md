### Pull Requests
We use pull requests to keep the document updating. Please clone this repository, make changes, and send pull request. 


### Audience
Please note that we target a wide range of web developers coming from all sorts of backgrounds. This means the recommendations we make must suit the average developer, and should be self-explanatory as much as possible. Let's try to keep the wording as simple as possible, but not miss anything important either. 

### For Sri Lankans
Generally, this list should be good for any cool kid wanting to develop and awesome site. However, we try to keep the recommendation suit better for the Sri Lankan audience. Let's not compromise anything, but rather fine tune the recommendations to match the network infrstructure we have in the country, the language, localization, internationalization, government regulations, etc.
